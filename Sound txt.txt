This soundscape is not what my original idea was meant to be a calming and sleepy sound. It turned into a much more spooky sound with the feeling of being in a forest. 
It is supposed to be storming out and you can hear the birds. I ended up using much more dark synths and have some background wind to add to the spookiness. There is also a chant that was very feminine, so I used the effects to pitch it down and to slow it down to get the effect that I wanted.
 Along with that I used the move tool, copy and paste, the cut tool, and the gain controls for seperate audio tracks. 
I had to make sure that no one track would be overbearing so that it would not be the only thing that you hear. I was not really aiming for a story to be in the sound and it is more of a audio that is just meant to be enjoyed rather than listend to for a story.
